# Tree
Suppose our base learner is one layer tree, i.e., we just split the data once so that the function is two piece constant function. Using matching pursuit.

# Adaboost
Use the above base learner, write code for Adaboost. Plot the learned classification boundary.

# one-NN
Write code for neural network with one hidden layer and ReLU non-linearity, and with bias (intercept) terms. Apply your neural network to the regression and classification problems in Tree and Adaboost
